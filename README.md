# Scrum Team App

## Please Note

All of the following commands are executed from the root directory of the repository.

## Getting Started - Back End

When developing, use the following command:
`npm run startBE`

This command will continuously run and compile your code as you work, so you don't have to keep restarting your server.

For production, use the following commands:
```bash
npm run buildBE
npm run serveBE
```

**buildBE** precompiles the code into the dist/BackEnd directory
**serveBE** runs the precompiled code from the dist/BackEnd directory 

## Acknowledgements

The setup and commands for the Back End come from https://github.com/babel/example-node-server
